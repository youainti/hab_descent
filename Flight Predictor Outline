This flight predictor will have the following main components

DataInput (APRSupload.py)
		This will take raw csv files, process them, and add them to the Database. It will only be used after a flight that has not been otherwise included in the dataset.
Database (DescentPredictor.db)
		This will hold all the data that has been cleaned so far.
Data interpreter (TimeSeries.py, DescentPredictor.py)
		This will read in data from the database and organize it for use by the statistical model.
Statistical Model (DescentPredictor.py, FlightModel.stan)
		This will build and run the statistical model, and return a set of probable values for use by the predictive model.
Predictive model (DescentPredictor.py)
		This will take elements from the statistical model and use it to create a flight prediction
		It will also take live data from some source, and build it into the model, while adding it to the dataset.
Display module (DisplayPrediction.py, DescentPredictor.py)
		This will take the predicted landing points and build an overall map of probable landing locations.
